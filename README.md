# Movie Recommendation System

## Dataset

We used a publically available dataset from Kaggle called the [TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv). This is a list of around 5k popular movies with plot overviews and other related data collected around 7 years ago. The database was generated using the [TMBd](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.
